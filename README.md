cd MEGA_-DEFI-

# No dependencies required - pure Python implementation
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from mega_defi.profit_machine import create_profit_machine

# Create a profit machine instance
machine = create_profit_machine(
    portfolio_value=10000,      # Starting portfolio value
    max_risk_per_trade=0.02,    # 2% risk per trade
    max_position_size=0.1        # 10% max position size
)

# Process market data
market_data = {
    'price': 100.0,
    'volume': 1000000,
    'liquidity': 5000000,
    'fee_rate': 0.003
}

recommendation = machine.process_market_data(market_data)

# Execute approved trades
if recommendation['approved']:
    result = machine.execute_trade(recommendation)
    print(f"Trade executed: {result}")

# Get performance report
machine.display_performance()
```

### Run Examples

```bash
# Basic usage example
python3 examples/basic_usage.py

# Advanced simulation with multiple strategies

```

## 📖 Architecture

The system is built on four core components:

1. **Strategy Engine** (`core/strategy_engine.py`)
   - Orchestrates multiple trading strategies
   - Executes strategy logic based on market conditions
   - Tracks strategy performance metrics

2. **Market Analyzer** (`core/market_analyzer.py`)
   - Analyzes price movements and trends
   - Calculates volatility and momentum
   - Identifies trading opportunities

3. **Risk Manager** (`core/risk_manager.py`)
   - Assesses risk for potential trades
   - Calculates optimal position sizing
   - Manages stop loss and take profit levels

4. **Profit Optimizer** (`core/profit_optimizer.py`)
   - Selects optimal strategies for market conditions
   - Optimizes entry and exit points
   - Tracks and improves performance over time

## 🎯 Core Strategies

### 1. Arbitrage
Exploits price differences across multiple exchanges. Automatically detects arbitrage opportunities when price spreads exceed thresholds.

### 2. Trend Following
Identifies and follows market trends. Enters positions when strong trends are detected with sufficient momentum.

### 3. Mean Reversion
Capitalizes on price deviations from moving averages. Trades when prices move significantly away from their historical means.

### 4. Momentum
Captures short-term price momentum. Enters positions based on recent price acceleration.

### 5. Liquidity Provision
Provides liquidity to earn fees. Evaluates liquidity pools and fee rates to maximize returns.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- Total profit/loss
- Win rate per strategy
- Average profit per trade
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Maximum drawdown
- Portfolio exposure

## 🔒 Risk Management Features

- **Position Sizing**: Dynamically adjusted based on volatility and risk level
- **Stop Loss**: Automatic stop loss calculation based on market conditions
- **Take Profit**: Risk-reward optimized take profit targets
