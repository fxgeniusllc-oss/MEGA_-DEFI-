## üìñ Architecture

The system is built on four core components:

1. **Strategy Engine** (`core/strategy_engine.py`)
   - Orchestrates multiple trading strategies
   - Executes strategy logic based on market conditions
   - Tracks strategy performance metrics

2. **Market Analyzer** (`core/market_analyzer.py`)
   - Analyzes price movements and trends
   - Calculates volatility and momentum
   - Identifies trading opportunities

3. **Risk Manager** (`core/risk_manager.py`)
   - Assesses risk for potential trades
   - Calculates optimal position sizing
   - Manages stop loss and take profit levels

4. **Profit Optimizer** (`core/profit_optimizer.py`)
   - Selects optimal strategies for market conditions
   - Optimizes entry and exit points
   - Tracks and improves performance over time

## üéØ Core Strategies

### 1. Arbitrage
Exploits price differences across multiple exchanges. Automatically detects arbitrage opportunities when price spreads exceed thresholds.

### 2. Trend Following
Identifies and follows market trends. Enters positions when strong trends are detected with sufficient momentum.
